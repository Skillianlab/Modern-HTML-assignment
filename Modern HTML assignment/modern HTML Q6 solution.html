    <h1>Differences between HTML and HTML5</h1>
    <table border="1">
        <tr>
            <th>HTML</th>
            <th>HTML5</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>HTML (versions prior to HTML5) primarily relied on generic div and span elements for layout, lacking this semantic richness.</td>
            <td>HTML5 introduced a range of semantic elements like &lt; header &gt; , &lt; nav &gt;, &lt; article &gt; , &lt; section &gt; , &lt; footer &gt;, and &lt; aside &gt;. These elements provide a more structured way to define the parts of a web page's content, making it easier for both developers and search engines to understand the page's layout and purpose.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>HTML required plugins for multimedia, which could be problematic due to compatibility issues and security concerns.</td>
            <td> HTML5 introduced native support for audio and video playback with the &lt; audio &gt; and &lt; video &Gt; elements. This eliminates the need for third-party plugins like Adobe Flash or external media players to display multimedia content.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>HTML had a limited set of input types, often requiring additional JavaScript for validation and user feedback.</td>
            <td>HTML5 introduced new input types for web forms, such as &lt; input type="email" &gt;, &lt; input type="url" &gt;, &lt; input type="date" &gt;, and more. These input types provide built-in validation and are designed to improve user experience and input accuracy. </td>
